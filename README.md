# dedup-tester
Bash script which uploads a set of standard files to SAFE Network for performance profiling and investigation of deduplication behaviour

Test files are downloaded from www.thinkbroadband.com. However on re-reading their site, this will have to be re-thought to avoid conflict.
"NOTE: We provide these download files primarily for UK broadband users; although we do not prohibit their use by others, we do not allow scripted/automated download of these files. Our systems routinely block repetitive attempts which we believe are automated or abusive. If you get an 'unauthorised' error message, you can contact us (please include your IP address when contacting us)."

We are only interested in the download performance of these files. Although they have a .zip extension, unzipping them will fail. All we are interested in is the download speed and integrity.
